    "# Conclusion\n",
    "This simple and straightforward data-driven investigation of the Seattle Airbnb market has provided us with insights may be helpful to anything keen to be involved in the property rental business. \n",
    "\n",
    "A data-driven strategy would be important for any potential Airbnb host to get the important things right, and to fine-tune their existing listings to obtain higher premiums for their listing prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "As per our investigation, there are factors that Airbnb hosts can tune: like (1) setting optimal prices/cleaning fees, (2) quick to reply, and (3) making the lodging available for more days of the year, and to some extent: (4) more amenities (perhaps adding on wifi, free breakfast, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "And there are factors that will be more relevant to people who are investing in a property or who have the resources to modify their lodgings, like: (1) making sure the property is situated in Downtown/Capitol Hill, (2) more rooms, (3) making whole apartments available instead of single-rooms, (4) enlarging the unit to accommodate more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding all these factors in depth will definitely provide an edge to anyone competing in the property rental market."
